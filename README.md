# CI Python Linter

This is an online Python linter built using `pycodestyle`, which students can use to validate Python for their projects.

The live site currently lives here: https://pep8ish.herokuapp.com

## How to use it

Simply visit the live site and paste in, or start typing Python code. Any issues around PEP8 compliance will be shown up in the results panel.

Alternatively, you can supply a GitHub raw link after the site address and the code will be pre-loaded, for example: https://pep8ish.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/Django3blog/master/12_final_deployment/blog/views.py

You can toggle between dark and light mode for the site using the Bootstrap toggle switch.
